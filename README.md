## General info
United States Geological Survey, or USGS, is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment; and the impacts of climate and land-use change.

In this project I have created an app that extracts all the earthquakes data of the last 30 days from the USGS API and represents it on a map. On top of that I have also implemented an extra layer of information that shows all tectonic plates, so that the user can see the relationship between earthquakes and the tectonic plates.

## Technologies
Project is created with:
* Angular
* Leaflet
	
## Setup
To run this project, install it locally using npm:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/aleixbadia/earthquake-map.git
